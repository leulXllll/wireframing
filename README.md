# wireframing
**Wireframing** is the process of creating simple visual layouts that outline the structure and basic elements of a user interface. It focuses on content placement, functionality, and user flowâ€”without using detailed design or colors.

### Benefits:
- Provides a clear visual guide for developers and designers.
- Helps identify usability issues early.

# Key Elements Found in Wireframing
## Key Elements in a Wireframe

### 1. Layout Structure
- **Explanation**: The skeletal framework that defines the arrangement of sections on a page.
- **Example**: A two-column layout where the left column displays booking options and the right column shows the booking summary.
- **Contribution**: Provides visual hierarchy and guides user focus for better usability.

### 2. Navigation
- **Explanation**: The components that allow users to move through different parts of the application.
- **Example**: A top navigation bar with links to "Home", "Bookings", "Profile", and "Support".
- **Contribution**: Ensures easy and intuitive movement through the system, enhancing user experience.

### 3. Content Placement
- **Explanation**: Indicates where text, images, forms, or other elements appear on the screen.
- **Example**: A form placed centrally on the page for entering guest details during booking.
- **Contribution**: Helps prioritize information and supports clear communication.

### 4. Functionality
- **Explanation**: Interactive elements and their behavior within the interface.
- **Example**: A clickable "Book Now" button that triggers the checkout process.
- **Contribution**: Demonstrates how users will interact with the system and ensures the UI meets task requirements.

# Types of Wireframes
## Low-Fidelity vs High-Fidelity Wireframes

**Low-Fidelity Wireframes**  
- **Definition**: Basic, sketch-like wireframes with simple shapes and placeholders.  
- **Used When**: Early in the design process to brainstorm layout and user flow.  
- **Example**: Hand-drawn or grayscale boxes representing buttons and text areas.

**High-Fidelity Wireframes**  
- **Definition**: Detailed wireframes with accurate spacing, real content, and interactive elements.  
- **Used When**: Later stages, for stakeholder reviews, usability testing, or developer handoff.  
- **Example**: Digital mockups with actual fonts, icons, and UI components.
